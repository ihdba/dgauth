This new opportunity is the key to their
desire and it’s only attainable through my new
mechanism.
That’s your mission. Write it down.
<br>
As you can see, you can break the one belief
down into three main elements: the new opportunity,
your prospect’s desire, and the new mechanism. Let’s
dig deeper into each one.
<br>
The new opportunity is what makes your idea
unique, your unique selling proposition (USP). If you
don’t have one, your idea is worthless.
    </p>

    <p>
      A fresh chance, a brand-new possibility of success where only disappointment has resulted before.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>
        The new opportunity reveals WHAT is unique about your solution, the new mechanism reveals HOW it works. 
      </b>
      <p>
        <i>
          Once you know your new opportunity, your customer’s desire, and your new mechanism, you’re ready to write down your one belief.
